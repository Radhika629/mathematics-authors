            Georg Bernhard Riemann (1826–1866) was a German mathematician whose groundbreaking work laid the foundations for several major areas of mathematics, including differential geometry, analysis, and number theory.<br> His ideas profoundly influenced the development of modern physics, especially Einstein’s theory of general relativity.<br>

            Key Information about Riemann:<br>
            Born: September 17, 1826, in Breselenz, Kingdom of Hanover (now in Germany)<br>
            Died: July 20, 1866, in Selasca, Italy.<br>
            Fields: Mathematics – particularly in geometry, complex analysis, and number theory.<br>

            Major Contributions:<br>
          
            Riemannian Geometry: He introduced concepts of curved space and manifolds, generalizing Euclidean geometry.<br> This later became a key part of Einstein’s general theory of relativity.<br>
            Riemann Hypothesis: Proposed in 1859, this famous conjecture concerns the distribution of prime numbers and the zeros of the Riemann zeta function.<br> It remains one of the most important unsolved problems in mathematics.<br>
            Riemann Integral: He formalized the concept of integration, laying the groundwork for modern analysis.<br>
            Complex Analysis: Riemann developed new methods using topology and conformal mappings, including the Riemann Mapping Theorem and Riemann surfaces.<br>

            Legacy:<br>
            Riemann’s 1854 lecture, "On the Hypotheses which lie at the Foundations of Geometry," revolutionized the way mathematicians thought about space and geometry.<br>
            Though he died young (at age 39), Riemann's work opened entirely new fields of research in both mathematics and physics.<br>
