            Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646–1716) was a German polymath, philosopher, mathematician, logician, diplomat, and scientist.<br>He is best known as one of the co-founders of calculus, independently of Isaac Newton, and for his pioneering work in logic, metaphysics, and the philosophy of language.<br>

            Key Information about Leibniz:<br>

            Born: July 1, 1646, in Leipzig, Electorate of Saxony (now Germany)<br>
            Died: November 14, 1716, in Hanover, Holy Roman Empire.<br>
            Fields: Mathematics, Philosophy, Logic, Law, Theology, History, Engineering, Linguistics.<br>

            Major Contributions:<br>

            Mathematics:<br>
            Infinitesimal Calculus: Developed differential and integral calculus independently of Newton, using notation (like dy/dx) still in use today.<br>
            Binary System: Introduced the binary number system (0s and 1s), foundational to modern computing.<br>
            Leibniz's Law: In logic and metaphysics, he proposed the identity of indiscernibles, a principle stating that no two distinct things can have all their properties in common.<br>

            Philosophy:<br>

            Monadology: Introduced the idea of monads—simple, indivisible, metaphysical units that make up the universe.<br>
            Optimism: Famously argued that we live in "the best of all possible worlds," a view later satirized by Voltaire in Candide.<br>
            Pre-established Harmony: Proposed that all substances in the universe operate in perfect coordination, without direct interaction.<br>

            Logic and Computing:<br>
            Anticipated symbolic logic and mechanical computation.<br>
            Designed an early mechanical calculator known as the Stepped Reckoner.<br>

            Legacy:<br>
            Leibniz's influence extends to computer science, logic, philosophy of mind, and linguistics.<br>
            Despite disputes with Newton over the invention of calculus, Leibniz’s mathematical notation proved more influential and is still widely used.<br>
