            David Hilbert (1862–1943) was a German mathematician and one of the most influential figures in 20th-century mathematics.<br> He made foundational contributions across many areas of mathematics and helped formalize the modern mathematical method of rigorous proof.<br>

            Key Information about David Hilbert:<br>

            Born: January 23, 1862, in Königsberg, Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia).<br>
            Died: February 14, 1943, in Göttingen, Germany.<br>
            Fields: Mathematics (particularly geometry, algebra, number theory, mathematical logic, functional analysis).<br>

            Major Contributions:<br>

            Hilbert’s Problems: In 1900, he presented a famous list of 23 unsolved problems at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris.<br> These problems guided much of the mathematical research in the 20th century.<br>
            Foundations of Geometry: In 1899, Hilbert published Grundlagen der Geometrie ("Foundations of Geometry"), where he systematically developed geometry using a formal axiomatic method.<br>
            Hilbert Space: He developed the concept of Hilbert space, which is fundamental to functional analysis and quantum mechanics.<br>
            Formalism in Mathematics: Hilbert was a leading advocate of the formalist approach to mathematics, seeking to base all mathematics on a consistent set of axioms.<br>
            Hilbert’s Program: A project to provide a solid foundation for all of mathematics by proving that mathematics is both complete and consistent—though later challenged by Gödel’s incompleteness theorems.<br>

            Legacy:<br>

            Hilbert trained and influenced many great mathematicians, including Emmy Noether and John von Neumann.<br>
            The Hilbert School in Göttingen was a major center of mathematical research in the early 20th century.<br>
