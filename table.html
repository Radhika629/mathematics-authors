            Pythagoras of Samos (c. 570 BCE – c. 495 BCE) was an ancient Greek philosopher and mathematician, best known for the Pythagorean Theorem in geometry.<br> He founded a religious and philosophical school that had a lasting influence on mathematics, philosophy, and mysticism.<br>

            Key Information about Pythagoras:<br>
            Born: c. 570 BCE, on the island of Samos, Greece.<br>
            Died: c. 495 BCE, likely in Metapontum (in modern-day Italy).<br>
            Fields: Mathematics, Philosophy, Music Theory, Astronomy, Ethics.<br>

            Notable Ideas and Contributions:<br>

            Pythagorean Theorem: In a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides (a² + b² = c²).<br>
            Belief that numbers are the essence of all things, influencing the development of mathematics and numerology.<br>

            Discovered mathematical ratios in musical harmony.<br>
            Advocated for the transmigration of souls (reincarnation).<br>
            Promoted a vegetarian and disciplined lifestyle as part of his philosophical teachings.<br>

            The Pythagorean School:<br>

            pythagoras founded a secretive philosophical-religious community in Croton (southern Italy), where members followed strict rules and studied mathematics, philosophy, and ethics.<br> Most of what we know about him comes from later sources, as Pythagoras himself left no written works,<br> and his teachings were often attributed to the group rather than the individual.<br>
            Pythagoras was both a historical figure and a semi-mythical one,<br> and many legends about his life make it difficult to distinguish fact from later invention.<br>
