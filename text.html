         Archimedes of Syracuse (c. 287 BCE – c. 212 BCE) was a Greek mathematician,physicist, engineer, inventor, and astronomer.<br> He is widely regarded as one of the greatest minds in classical antiquity and one of the most influential scientists of all time.<br>

        Key Information about Archimedes:<br>

        Born: c. 287 BCE in Syracuse, a city-state on the island of Sicily<br>
        Died: c. 212 BCE during the Roman conquest of Syracuse<br>
        Fields: Mathematics, Physics, Engineering, Astronomy<br>

        Notable Contributions:<br>

        Discovery of the principle of buoyancy (known as Archimedes’ Principle)<br>
        Invention of ingenious war machines to defend Syracuse
        Development of mathematical concepts such as the method of exhaustion<br>
        (a precursor to integral calculus)<br>
        Invented the Archimedean screw for raising water<br>
        Proved formulas for volumes and surface areas of solids like spheres and cylinders

        Archimedes wrote many works,<br> most of which were mathematical treatises, including:
        On the Sphere and Cylinder<br>

         Measurement of a Circle
         On Floating Bodies
         The Sand Reckoner
         The Method of Mechanical Theorems<br>

         His works were originally written in Greek and were later translated into Latin and Arabic,<br> influencing medieval science and the Renaissance.
